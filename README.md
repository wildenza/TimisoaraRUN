<h1 align="center">Timisoara RUN</h1>

<p align="center">
TimisoaraRUN is a website I created for a college assignment. <br />
  It is made for a fictional running marathon, where people can participate.  <br />

I've managed to incorporate 3D objects imported from Blender as .obj files using Google's Model Viewer API <br />
  So one user can visualise one or more of the low-poly representations of the real life locations such as Parcul Rozelor & Piata Victoriei. <br />
This project has served a great learning path for me, managing to lay an adequate knowledge foundation for future projects
